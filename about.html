                <p>Hello there! My name is Alan and I'm from San Diego, born and raised. In my free time, I like to engage in my various hobbies. 
                    I like making art, whether it be digital, painting, or just using a pencil. I specialize in hyper-realistic
                    graphite art, but have been exploring other areas such as digital manga art as well as oil painting. I also enjoy 
                    cooking, especially cooking for friends and family. My favorite cuisines to cook are Cantonese
                    comfort food as well as many Japanese dishes. I also like running, rock climbing and going to the gym. 
                    My current goal is to run a marathon by the end of summer and gain 10 pounds of muscle by the end of the year. 
                    And right now, I'm getting into acoustic guitar. I used to play to violin so it's somewhat similar, 
                    but similiar doesn't mean that it's easy. Even though it's harder and I'm only a beginner, I like 
                    playing fingerstyle guitar because I find it much more rewarding. 
                </p>
                <p>My favorite ice cream flavor is cherry.</p>
